# AI-for-Tic-Tac-Toe
AI for the game TicTacToe that uses the minimax algorithm to choose the optimum move.  
The only possible terminal game states are either the AI wins or it is a tie. The minimax algorithm used ensures that the player can't win.  
Completed as part of Harvards CS50 Intro to AI Course.  
 

Note: I was responsible for writing the code in the tictactoe.py file. The rest of the code is provided by Harvard CS50 and is not my own work.  

To run the script simply execute python runner.py in the command line.
